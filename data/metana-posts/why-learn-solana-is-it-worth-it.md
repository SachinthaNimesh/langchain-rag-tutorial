Why Learn Solana? Is it worth¬†it?
=================================

Solana is now the **fourth-biggest cryptocurrency in the world**, but what does the future look like for blockchain developers. Should you learn Solana right now? Let‚Äôs take a deep dive into this topic in this article.


![](https://metana.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/solana-sol.gif)
Solana blockchain is catching up at lightning-fast speed. The cryptocurrency has passed Cardano & Ripple, and the blockchain has doubled down engineering on gaming in the crypto universe.


![](https://metana.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Comparison-of-Net2works.png)
We all know that gas fees are a pain in the ass. And that‚Äôs something together with a lot of things solved by Solana. With a lightning transaction speed and the lowest transaction fee you could go for, some even argue that Solana is a potential Ethereum killer.


Given the massive user bases and high transaction volumes involved, the popularity of emerging categories such as play-to-earn gaming and NFTs in the cryptocurrency market offers a huge opportunity for Solana.

**Amazing projects on Solana**


* **Audius** is a music streaming and sharing platform that puts power back into the hands of content creators with 6M active listeners every month.
* **Serum** is a decentralized exchange (DEX) and ecosystem that brings unprecedented speed and low transaction costs to decentralized finance.
* **Media Network** is a privacy-first and community-governed CDN that allows you to scale your infrastructure within seconds.
* **Solfarm** is a yield aggregator running on the Solana blockchain that offers customers auto-compounding vault strategies.
* **Mango Markets** is a decentralized cross-margin trading platform where users can use up to 5x leverage with lightning-fast network speed.


Solana‚Äôs token SOL is also listed in all major exchanges including Coinbase, FTX, Binance, and everyone knows it‚Äôs here to stay.


**So how do you become a Solana blockchain developer?**


Getting in the game fast is the strategy, learning content fast is how you skill up. The average salary today goes around $145k-$271k, with 8000 job openings for blockchain engineers within [ziprecruiter](https://www.ziprecruiter.com/Jobs/Blockchain-Developer/-in-San-Francisco,CA) in SF alone.¬†


Solana is based on the Rust programming language, to learn to work with the blockchain, you need to learn Rust. Once you are good with it, it‚Äôs about getting hands-on with Solana and building your own portfolio.


At [**Metana**](https://metana.io), we offer a 4-month boot camp if you want to make a career move to web3. We have a Solana-based blockchain boot camp where at the end of the boot camp, you‚Äôll work as a Solana blockchain developer.
