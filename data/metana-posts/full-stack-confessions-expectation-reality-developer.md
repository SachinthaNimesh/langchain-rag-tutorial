The role of a **full stack developer** is often seen as a great opportunity, promising the mastery of both front end and back end technologies. The most frequent opinion about this role is that it will make your dream a reality of getting into a fulfilling and sophisticated career in tech.

The Shimmering Expectations
---------------------------


The full stack developer‚Äôs journey often begins with high hopes. There‚Äôs an appealing thought of gaining expertise in a wide array of technologies, from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end to server-side languages like Python, Ruby, or Node.js. The ability to handle both databases and user interfaces suggests a powerful control over the entire spectrum of a project, enhancing job prospects and creative freedom.


The Grounded Reality
--------------------


However, the practical experiences of [full stack developers](https://metana.io/blog/full-stack-developer-vs-software-engineer/) reveal a more fine picture.
