Low Level Call vs High Level Call in Solidity [Simplified]
==========================================================

 



 * [Metana Editorial](https://metana.io/blog/author/editorial/)
* [May 17, 2024](https://metana.io/blog/2024/05/17/)
* [Blockchain](https://metana.io/blog/category/blockchain/), [Solidity](https://metana.io/blog/category/solidity/)














In Solidity, contracts can interact with other contracts in two main ways: through **high level calls** using the contract‚Äôs interface or **low level calls** using methods like `call`, `delegatecall`, and `staticcall`. Though both approaches use the CALL opcode at the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) level, their handling and behavior in Solidity differ significantly.


Understanding High Level and Low Level Calls
--------------------------------------------


### High Level Calls:


High-level calls in Solidity are made using the contract‚Äôs interface. This method is user-friendly and includes automatic error handling. For example:



```
contractInstance.someFunction();

```

When this call is made, Solidity generates the appropriate bytecode to handle success and failure cases, ensuring that any errors in the called function result in a revert of the transaction.


### Low Level Calls:


Low-level calls provide more control but require explicit handling of errors. They are made using methods like `call`:



```
(bool success, bytes memory data) = targetAddress.call(abi.encodeWithSignature("someFunction()"));

```

This method returns a boolean indicating the success of the call and any returned data, but it does not automatically revert on failure.



![low level call vs high level call](https://metana.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Pair-programming-rafiki.svg)
Detailed Comparison
-------------------


**Behavior on Failure**: When a high-level call fails, Solidity automatically reverts the transaction, bubbling up the error. This behavior simplifies error handling for developers:



```
contractInstance.someFunction(); // This will revert if someFunction fails

```

In contrast, a low-level call requires manual checking of the success value:



```
(bool success, ) = targetAddress.call(abi.encodeWithSignature("someFunction()"));<br>require(success, "Call failed");
```

If the low-level call fails, the `success` value will be `false`, and the transaction will continue unless explicitly handled.


**Calling Non-Existent Contracts**: High-level calls check if the target address contains a contract before executing the call. If the address does not contain code (checked via the `EXTCODESIZE` opcode), the call will revert:



```
interface IContract {
    function someFunction() external;
}

IContract(targetAddress).someFunction(); // Reverts if targetAddress has no contract

```

Low-level calls, however, do not perform this check and will return `false` if the address has no contract:



```
(bool success, ) = targetAddress.call(abi.encodeWithSignature("someFunction()"));
require(success, "Call to non-existent contract failed");

```

Practical Example
-----------------


Here‚Äôs a practical comparison of high-level and low-level calls within a Solidity contract:


**High-Level Call Example**:



```
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract HighLevelCaller {
    function callFunction(address _target) public {
        ITarget(_target).targetFunction(); // Reverts if targetFunction fails
    }
}

interface ITarget {
    function targetFunction() external;
}

```

**Low-Level Call Example**:



```
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract LowLevelCaller {
    function callFunction(address _target) public {
        (bool success, ) = _target.call(abi.encodeWithSignature("targetFunction()"));
        require(success, "Low-level call failed");
    }
}

```

### Key Takeaways


1. **Ease of Use vs. Control**: High-level calls offer ease of use and built-in safety, making them ideal for standard interactions. Low-level calls provide greater control and flexibility, useful for advanced scenarios requiring manual handling of call results.
2. **Error Handling**: High-level calls automatically revert on failure, simplifying error management. Low-level calls require explicit success checks and error handling.
3. **Contract Existence Check**: High-level calls check for the existence of the contract at the target address, reverting if none is found. Low-level calls do not perform this check, requiring manual verification if necessary.


By understanding the differences between high-level and low-level calls, Solidity developers can choose the appropriate method for their specific use cases, balancing ease of use with the need for control and flexibility.

FAQs
----


**What is a low level call in Solidity?**


* A low level call in Solidity refers to using functions like¬†`call`,¬†`delegatecall`,¬†`staticcall`, or¬†`callcode`¬†to interact with other contracts. These are more flexible but riskier.


**What is a high level call in Solidity?**


* A high level call uses Solidity‚Äôs function calls to interact with other contracts, which are safer and easier to use than low-level calls.


**When should I use low-level calls in Solidity?**


* Low-level calls should be used when you need more control over the call process or when interacting with contracts that don‚Äôt expose an ABI.


**What are the risks of using low-level calls in Solidity?**


* Low-level calls can fail silently, making them vulnerable to security issues such as reentrancy attacks if not handled correctly.


**How can I make low-level calls safer in Solidity?**


* To make low-level calls safer, always check the return value, use appropriate security patterns, and consider using high-level calls when possible.


**Why are high-level calls preferred in Solidity development?**


* High-level calls are preferred because they are simpler to use, provide better error handling, and integrate seamlessly with Solidity‚Äôs type system.


**What are common use cases for high-level calls in Solidity?**


* High-level calls are commonly used for standard contract interactions, such as transferring tokens or interacting with DeFi protocols.


**Can I combine high-level and low-level calls in a Solidity contract?**


* Yes, combining both types of calls can be useful. High-level calls offer simplicity, while low-level calls provide flexibility when needed.


**What are some best practices for using calls in Solidity?**


* Best practices include favoring high-level calls, handling all call returns, implementing checks-effects-interactions patterns, and avoiding unnecessary complexity.


**How do high-level calls handle errors in Solidity?**


* High-level calls automatically revert on failure, providing built-in error handling which simplifies debugging and improves contract reliability.
