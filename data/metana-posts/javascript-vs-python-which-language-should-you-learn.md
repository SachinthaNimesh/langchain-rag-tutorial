-----------------------------------------------


### JavaScript


Invented by Brendan Eich in just 10 days, JavaScript‚Äôs primary purpose was to add interactivity to web pages. JavaScript is an **interpreted language**, meaning the code is translated line by line during execution. It‚Äôs also **dynamically typed**, where variables don‚Äôt have a pre-defined data type assigned, offering flexibility but potentially leading to runtime errors. JavaScript excels in the realm of **front-end development**. The code runs within web browsers, manipulating the HTML content and user interactions. However, with the rise of frameworks like Node.js, JavaScript has transcended its browser-bound roots. Node.js allows JavaScript to execute on the server-side, enabling the creation of real-time applications and APIs.


### Python


**Guido van Rossum** designed Python with a focus on readability and programmer productivity. It‚Äôs an **interpreted language** like JavaScript, but **statically typed**, meaning variables must be declared with a specific data type. This enforces stricter code and helps catch errors early. Python‚Äôs versatility shines in various domains, including:


* **Web Development:** Frameworks like Django and Flask streamline back-end development.
* **Data Science and Machine Learning:** Extensive libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn make Python a go-to choice for data analysis, manipulation, and building ML models.
