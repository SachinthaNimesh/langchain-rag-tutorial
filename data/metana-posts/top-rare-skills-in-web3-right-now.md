Introduction to Rare Skills
---------------------------


The new version of the Internet, called Web3, is bringing lots of fresh and exciting changes. It lets us make apps that use [blockchain technology](https://metana.io/blog/how-does-the-blockchain-work-blockchain-technology-explained-in-simple-words/), which is a super safe way to share and store information. Because of these changes, there are new jobs that need people with special skills. In this article, we will look at the skills that are most needed for working in the Web3 field.


### Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Skills


Decentralized Finance, or DeFi, is a fast-growing sector within the Web3 space that aims to provide traditional financial services in a decentralized manner. To be successful in DeFi, developers need to understand how to code [smart contract](https://metana.io/blog/extension-for-learning-solidity-and-generate-smart-contracts-using-aiprm/)s, develop decentralized exchanges, and build decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). Additionally, knowledge of financial instruments and regulations is essential.


Decentralized Finance, also known as DeFi, is a new area in the Web3 field that is growing really fast. DeFi is about offering financial services but without a central authority. To do well in DeFi, developers need to learn how to write smart contracts, create decentralized exchanges, and build groups that operate on their own known as DAOs. Also, it‚Äôs important to know about things like loans, insurance and rules that must be followed.


### Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) Skills


NFTs are unique digital assets that are indivisible and cannot be exchanged for another asset on a one-to-one basis. They are currently being used for everything from art and collectibles to gaming and virtual real estate. To excel in NFTs, developers need to understand how to create and manage NFTs, build NFT marketplaces, and integrate NFTs with other Web3 applications.



![nft](https://metana.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/nft-1024x683.jpg)
### Web3 Infrastructure Skills


Web3 infrastructure includes the networks, protocols, and tools used to build decentralized applications. Developers need to have a deep understanding of blockchain technology, peer-to-peer networks, and decentralized storage solutions. They also need to know how to work with [Web3 development](https://metana.io/web3-blockchain-bootcamps-courses/) frameworks like Ethereum, Polkadot, and Cosmos.


### Smart Contracts Skills


[Smart contracts are self-executing agreements that run on blockchain](https://metana.io/blog/what-is-a-smart-contract-understand-contracts-on-the-blockchain/) technology. They enable the creation of decentralized applications and the automation of various business processes. To work with smart contracts, developers need to have expertise in coding, cryptography, and the legal aspects of contracts.


### Cryptography Skills


Cryptography is the foundation of blockchain technology and is essential for securing Web3 applications. To work in cryptography, developers need to have a deep understanding of cryptographic protocols, hashing algorithms, digital signatures, and encryption techniques.

### Final Thoughts


The Web3 space is still in its early stages, and the demand for these rare skills is expected to grow as the industry continues to mature. [Developers who can master these skills will be in high demand and will be able to command top salaries](https://metana.io/blog/solidity-developer-salary/). Whether you are a developer, designer, or entrepreneur, [learning these rare skills will give you a competitive edge in the Web3 space.](https://metana.io/blog/step-by-step-how-to-start-learning-web3/)


In conclusion, the Web3 space is growing at an unprecedented rate, and it requires a unique set of skills to succeed. Understanding DeFi, NFTs, Web3 infrastructure, smart contracts, and cryptography will position you for success in this exciting new industry.
