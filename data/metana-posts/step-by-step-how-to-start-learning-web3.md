Step by Step: How To Start Learning Web3
========================================

 



 * [Metana Editorial](https://metana.io/blog/author/editorial/)
* [October 26, 2022](https://metana.io/blog/2022/10/26/)
* [Blockchain](https://metana.io/blog/category/blockchain/), [Jobs](https://metana.io/blog/category/jobs/), [Smart Contracts](https://metana.io/blog/category/smart-contracts/), [Web3.0](https://metana.io/blog/category/web3-0/)














Due to the high salaries of web3 developers in the blockchain sector, many aspiring and seasoned web2 developers aim to learn web3 development.


According to platforms like Web3 Careers, Senior Software Engineers with development experience in Solidity can earn a starting salary of $200,000 a year, and as remote-first work on dispersed teams is typical for many web3 firms, many developers find working in web3 to be an appealing career path.

With all the buzz surrounding blockchain technology and investments in web3 businesses, developers are left wondering how to get started learning web3 development and working in the web3 sector.


Fear not fellow developers! In this article, we will explore a step-by-step guide on **how to start learning Web3** development, from following the best builders in this space to learning through guided tutorials.


Step 1: Follow Web3 Developers On Twitter
-----------------------------------------


A few notable names in this space:


* **@[VitalikButerin](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin)** ‚Äì Co-founder of Ethereum
* **@[aeyakovenko](https://twitter.com/aeyakovenko)** ‚Äì Co-founder of Solana
* **@[TimBeiko](https://twitter.com/TimBeiko)** ‚Äì core Ethereum developer leading many Ethereum updates


If you want to follow more entrepreneurs in this space, a few personal recommendations include:

You may follow numerous feeds at once using tools like [TweetDeck](https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/) or RSS, and Twitter Lists are another method to categorize the individuals you follow into distinct niches like DeFi and NFTs or different categories like Ethereum development, Solana development, etc.


Step 2: Check Out Guided Web3 Development Tutorials On YouTube
--------------------------------------------------------------


There are an increasing number of [web3 developers](https://metana.io/blog/web3-solidity-courses/) on YouTube in addition to Twitter.YouTube is a useful medium for giving detailed explanations of important ideas and for visually demonstrating coding tasks. Some of our favorites are as follows:


**1. Web3 Foundation ‚Äì official Web3 Foundation channel with a ton of useful information**
