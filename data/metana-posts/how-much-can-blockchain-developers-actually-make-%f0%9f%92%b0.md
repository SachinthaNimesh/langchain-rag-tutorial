Blockchain Developer: The most hyped job in 2022. A Blockchain developer is¬†**a highly skilled individual who can efficiently code for designing, developing, and testing blockchain applications**.


![](https://metana.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/blockchain-vs-dapps.jpeg)
Now you know blockchain developers work on building a blockchain. There are different types of blockchain developers, who work on different blockchains. Just like we have android developers and iOS developers, we have solidity developers & rust developers & a lot more for different blockchains available today.


Now to the answer you‚Äôll have been waiting for. How much do blockchain developers really bag? 


![](https://metana.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Screen-Shot-2022-02-06-at-7.47.33-PM-1024x630.png)

*Source ‚Äì [ZipRecruiter](https://www.ziprecruiter.com/Salaries/Blockchain-Developer-Salary) (Blockchain Developer Salary)*


According to ZipRecruiter the national average in the US is $154,550/year which goes as high as $242,000/year. 


The above numbers are amazing, but there‚Äôs something we all are missing. As a blockchain developer, you can make money with freelance projects. Blockchain engineers are like a very rare sector of diamonds, there are tons of projects that are looking for blockchain engineers.
