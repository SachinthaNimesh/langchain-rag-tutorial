Have you ever faced a sudden stop sign while navigating the Ethereum universe? **Meet the execution reverted errors, the EVM‚Äôs way of keeping things in check**. Imagine the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) as a smart, powerful computer that runs the show for Ethereum‚Äôs smart contracts. But sometimes, things don‚Äôt go as planned. This is where ‚Äú**EVM execution reverted errors**‚Äù come in. Think of them as the EVM saying, ‚ÄúOops, something went wrong!‚Äù These errors stop a contract when there‚Äôs a problem. For people who make these contracts, understanding these errors is super important. It helps them fix mistakes and make everything run smoothly. And for users, it means less trouble and better trust in using Ethereum. Let‚Äôs learn more about these errors and why they matter.


What are EVM Execution Reverted Errors?
---------------------------------------


Navigating through the Ethereum blockchain can sometimes feel like a thrilling puzzle, especially when you encounter something known as an ‚ÄúEVM execution reverted error.‚Äù Let‚Äôs break this down in a simple way, so even if you‚Äôre new to Ethereum, you‚Äôll understand what these errors are, how they‚Äôre different from other errors, and what typically causes them.



![](https://metana.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/code_20240124_102244_via_10015_io-1024x703.png)
### What Are EVM Execution Reverted Errors?


Imagine you‚Äôre playing a video game where you need to follow specific rules to move to the next level. Now, if you don‚Äôt follow a rule, the game stops you from moving forward. EVM execution reverted errors are similar. They occur when a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain hits a snag because a certain rule or condition isn‚Äôt met. These errors are the EVM‚Äôs way of saying, ‚ÄúWait, we can‚Äôt do this because something is not right.‚Äù This stop is important because it prevents any bad or incorrect transactions from happening.


### How Are They Different from Other Ethereum Errors?


Ethereum can have several types of errors, but EVM execution reverted errors are unique. They specifically relate to the rules and logic of smart contracts. Unlike other errors that might happen because of technical issues like network problems or incorrect gas estimates (which is like the fee you pay to make transactions), EVM execution reverted errors are all about the contract‚Äôs code and logic. They are the EVM‚Äôs method of enforcing the contract‚Äôs rules strictly.


Common Causes of EVM Reverted Errors
------------------------------------


### Smart Contract Business Logic Violations


Imagine a smart contract as a set of rules that everyone agrees to follow. Now, if someone tries to do something that goes against these rules, the EVM steps in and stops it. This is what we call a business logic violation. For example, if a contract is designed to only allow withdrawals of a certain amount of cryptocurrency, and someone tries to take out more, the EVM will revert the transaction, saying, ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt do that!‚Äù


### Out of Gas Errors


Ethereum transactions require fuel, known as ‚Äúgas,‚Äù to run. Each operation in a transaction costs a certain amount of gas. If you start a transaction without enough gas, it‚Äôs like trying to drive a car without enough fuel ‚Äì you won‚Äôt get far. The EVM stops these transactions, indicating you‚Äôve run out of gas.


### Invalid JUMP and Stack Overflow/Underflow Errors


These errors are a bit more technical but think of them as the EVM getting confused due to a misdirection or overload. An invalid JUMP error occurs when a transaction tries to execute an operation that doesn‚Äôt exist or isn‚Äôt currently available. Stack overflow and underflow errors happen when there‚Äôs too much or too little data in the EVM‚Äôs memory stack, respectively. It‚Äôs like trying to put too many or too few books in a stack; either way, it becomes unstable.


### Invalid Opcode Errors


Opcode stands for ‚Äúoperation code,‚Äù which is a part of the EVM‚Äôs language. An invalid opcode error happens when the EVM encounters an unknown or invalid command. It‚Äôs like giving someone instructions in a language they don‚Äôt understand; they won‚Äôt know what to do.


### LedgerAPI Errors and Other Specific Scenarios


These errors are specific to certain interfaces and tools used in Ethereum, like Ledger Live. They usually occur due to issues like network congestion or incorrect transaction pricing. It‚Äôs similar to trying to make a call during a network outage ‚Äì the call just won‚Äôt go through.


Understanding these common causes of EVM reverted errors can be a huge help in navigating Ethereum‚Äôs ecosystem. It‚Äôs all about knowing the rules, having enough gas, giving clear instructions, and being aware of network issues. With this knowledge, you‚Äôll be better equipped to handle the challenges of Ethereum transactions and smart contract interactions.


Debugging EVM Reverted Errors
-----------------------------


When encountering EVM reverted errors, practical examples can be incredibly helpful to understand the application of various debugging tools. Here are some scenarios to illustrate their use:


### Using Remix Debugger UI


**Example Scenario**: You have a smart contract for a voting application and encounter an error when a user attempts to vote.


**How Remix Helps**: With Remix Debugger UI, you input the transaction hash that failed. The debugger lets you step through the transaction. You notice that the error occurs at a line where the contract checks if the user has already voted. The error is because the contract incorrectly flags the user as having voted already, even on their first vote. This visual step-by-step process makes it easy to spot where things go wrong.


### Utilizing Truffle Debug


**Example Scenario**: A token contract transaction fails during a token transfer.


**How Truffle Helps**: By running `truffle debug <transaction_hash>`, you enter a debugging session for the failed transaction. As you step through the code, you find that the error is due to insufficient token balance in the sender‚Äôs account ‚Äì a detail you might have overlooked without this detailed inspection.


### Implementing Custom Code for Transaction Inspection


**Example Scenario**: A smart contract for an auction fails when a bid is placed.


**How Custom Code Helps**: You write a script using Ethereum‚Äôs JSON RPC API to simulate the transaction. This script reveals that the bid is lower than the current highest bid, causing the failure ‚Äì a fact not evident from the transaction receipt.


### Leveraging REST API Gateway Features


**Example Scenario**: A transaction in a decentralized application fails to process.


**How REST API Helps**: Using a service like Infura, you send a request to the REST API with the transaction details. The API returns a more detailed error message, indicating that the transaction failed due to a mismatch in the contract‚Äôs expected parameters.


### Employing Tenderly Debugger for Detailed Analysis


**Example Scenario**: A complex transaction in a DeFi contract fails, with the cause unclear.


**How Tenderly Helps**: After inputting the transaction into Tenderly, you see a detailed trace. It reveals that the transaction fails due to an unexpected reentrancy bug. Tenderly shows the state changes and function calls that led to this issue, which would have been difficult to trace manually.

Case Studies and Examples of EVM Reverted Errors
------------------------------------------------


Exploring real-world cases and specific examples of EVM reverted errors can provide invaluable insights into their nature and resolution. Let‚Äôs delve into a few instances that highlight common issues encountered in Ethereum smart contract development, along with their analysis and solutions.


### Case Study 1: The Overdrawn Token Transfer


**Scenario**: In a token transfer transaction on a DeFi platform, users repeatedly faced the `execution reverted: transfer amount exceeds balance` error.


**Analysis**: The smart contract was designed to transfer tokens from one account to another. However, users attempting to transfer more tokens than they had in their balance triggered this error. This is a classic case of a business logic violation where the contract‚Äôs conditions weren‚Äôt met.


**Resolution**: The developers updated the user interface to clearly show available token balances and added checks to prevent users from entering an amount greater than their current balance. Additionally, the error message was made more user-friendly to enhance understanding.


### Case Study 2: The Gasless Vote


**Scenario**: A decentralized voting application saw transactions failing with the error `execution reverted: out of gas`.


**Analysis**: This error occurred because the gas limit set for the transaction was insufficient to execute all the operations required by the voting contract. The gas estimation was not accurately accounting for the contract‚Äôs complexity.


**Resolution**: The developers implemented a dynamic gas estimation mechanism in the application that considered the current state and complexity of the smart contract, ensuring sufficient gas was provided for each transaction.


### Case Study 3: The Failed Auction Bid


**Scenario**: An auction contract was reporting `execution reverted: invalid jump destination` errors.


**Analysis**: This error was traced back to a function in the contract that was improperly jumping to a non-existent or wrong part of the code. The issue was due to a bug in how the contract‚Äôs functions were organized and called.


**Resolution**: The contract code was refactored, ensuring all jumps and calls were correctly directed to valid functions. Comprehensive testing was conducted to prevent similar issues in the future.


### Case Study 4: The Unreachable Function


**Scenario**: A complex financial smart contract was giving the `execution reverted: invalid opcode` error.


**Analysis**: The error was caused by the contract trying to execute an operation that was not supported by the EVM. It turned out that the contract was compiled with a newer version of Solidity that was not fully supported by the current EVM.


**Resolution**: The contract was recompiled with a compatible Solidity version, and tests were run to ensure all operations were supported by the EVM. Developers also ensured that future contracts would be compatible with the EVM version used on their target network.


Best Practices to Avoid EVM Reverted Errors
-------------------------------------------


Minimizing EVM reverted errors is crucial for a seamless experience in Ethereum smart contract development. Here are some best practices to help prevent common mistakes and ensure the robustness of your smart contracts:


### Writing Robust Smart Contract Code


* **Clear and Concise Logic**: Write clear, straightforward code. Avoid complex and convoluted logic that can lead to misunderstandings and errors.
* **Validate User Inputs**: Always validate inputs to your functions. This can help prevent unexpected behavior and ensure that your functions are being used correctly.
* **Handle Exceptions Appropriately**: Use `[require](https://metana.io/blog/require-assert-revert-solidity/)`, `revert`, and `assert` statements judiciously to handle exceptions and ensure that errors are clear and informative.
* **Avoid Loops Where Possible**: Loops can lead to out-of-gas errors if not carefully managed. Try to design contracts that minimize the use of loops, especially those with potentially unbounded iterations.
* **Use Modifiers for Reusability**: Modifiers can help you manage repetitive tasks like access control, reducing the chances of mistakes.


### Regular Testing and Auditing Practices


* **Unit Testing**: Write comprehensive unit tests for your smart contracts to ensure that each function behaves as expected in various scenarios.
* **Integration Testing**: Test how your contracts interact with each other and with other contracts to catch any integration issues.
* **Use Test Networks**: Before deploying on the mainnet, use testnets like Ropsten or Rinkeby to thoroughly test your contracts in an environment that simulates the Ethereum mainnet.
* **Professional Audits**: Engage with professional auditing firms to review your code. They can provide an expert perspective and identify vulnerabilities you might have missed.


### Keeping Abreast with Ethereum Updates and Community Best Practices


* **Stay Updated with Ethereum Releases**: Follow Ethereum updates and understand how changes in the network, like upgrades or hard forks, may affect your contracts.
* **Follow Solidity Releases**: Keep track of Solidity updates, as new compiler versions can introduce optimizations and changes in behavior.
* **Engage with the Community**: Participate in Ethereum developer forums, Reddit, Stack Exchange, and other platforms to learn from others‚Äô experiences and keep up with best practices.
* **Leverage Established Patterns**: Use design patterns and best practices established by the Ethereum community to avoid common pitfalls.
* **Continuous Learning**: The blockchain space evolves rapidly. Commit to continuous learning to stay ahead of new challenges and solutions in smart contract development.


Future of EVM Error Handling
