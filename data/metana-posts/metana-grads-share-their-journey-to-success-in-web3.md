Metana‚Äôs Bootcamp is rewriting the rules of blockchain education by focusing on personal growth and providing each and every student with the skills, industry connections, and confidence needed to succeed in the fast-changing Web3 world. 


It takes their students from curious newbies to successful blockchain developers who go on to find their dream job in the Web3 market. This article spotlights 3 of Metana‚Äôs exceptional grads and their journey of change and success with Metana‚Äôs all-inclusive training approach.


Santiago‚Äôs Journey from Enthusiast to Web3 Professional
-------------------------------------------------------


![santiagometana, success, success stories, grads, metana reviews](https://metana.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Santiago-Trujillo-Zuluaga.jpeg)
Santiago Trujillo already had his foundation in Solidity and JavaScript before joining [Metana‚Äôs Bootcamp](https://metana.io/blog/is-the-metana-bootcamp-legit-solidity-bootcamp-aiml/) in February 2023, aiming to succeed in the competitive Web3 job market.


Over three to four months, he dedicated about 20 hours weekly to mastering advanced blockchain development through Metana‚Äôs comprehensive curriculum. This not only deepened his technical knowledge but also provided access to invaluable resources and support.


Engaging deeply with the Metana community, Santiago succeeded in a collaborative environment, enhancing his experience by partnering with fellow students on projects, which prepared him for real-world challenges. **His commitment and effort paid off in securing a Developer Relations (DevRel) [role in the Web3 industry](https://metana.io/blog/technical-roles-within-the-blockchain-web3-industry/) before completing the program.**



Matt Bertin: From Web3 Skeptic to Industry Leader
-------------------------------------------------



![matt bertin](https://metana.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Mathieu-Bertin-edited.jpeg)
Initially skeptical about transitioning from traditional software development to Web3, Matt Bertin‚Äôs curiosity led him to enroll in Metana‚Äôs Solidity Bootcamp. With a background in software development using Nextjs, React, and Nodejs, and proficiency in Typescript, Matt quickly adapted to the core concepts of Solidity. 


He thrived in the bootcamp‚Äôs collaborative and challenging environment, actively participating in module assignments and leading teams in Capture-the-Flag (CTF) challenges, which not only enhanced his understanding but also established him as a leader within the community.


The instructors at Metana noted Matt‚Äôs dedication and enthusiasm, recognizing his ability to simplify complex technical problems into actionable solutions. This skill set proved invaluable, and before completing the program, Matt secured a remote position with a $125,000 starting salary at a pioneering company in the Web3 industry. 


Reflecting on his journey, Matt acknowledges,


***‚ÄúMetana not only erased my doubts but equipped me with the skills and confidence to succeed in the exciting world of Web3.‚Äù***



Shiran‚Äôs Leap from Full Stack to Blockchain Innovator at Metana
---------------------------------------------------------------



![Shiran ](https://metana.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/1707928589548.jpeg)
Shiran, an experienced full stack developer previously with tech giants like Amazon and Nike, started on a transformative journey with Metana‚Äôs Solidity Bootcamp in November 2023. Aiming to pivot his career towards smart contract development in the growing Web3 space, Shiran brought his strong background and leadership skills to the challenge. 


Over six months, he fully immersed himself in the Solidity and [blockchain development](https://metana.io/blog/why-become-a-blockchain-developer-whats-in-it-for-you/) environment, making the most of the current bootcamp modules, expert instructors and encouraging peers for an extensive educational experience.


Additionally, Shiran engaged with the broader blockchain community by participating in open-source projects, helping him build valuable connections that enhanced both his learning and career prospects. **This comprehensive approach lead in to a significant career transition when he graduated in April 2024 and subsequently joined Hypotenuse Labs.**



Skills + Community = Success ‚ú®
------------------------------


The success stories of Santiago, Matt, and Shiran at Metana.io exemplify the deep impact of a tailored educational approach in the fast-evolving blockchain field.


Each narrative showcases the bootcamp‚Äôs ability to blend rigorous technical training with a supportive community environment, facilitating not just skill acquisition but also significant career transformations. 


Santiago‚Äôs transition into a specialized Web3 role highlights the practical application of learned skills. Matt‚Äôs shift from skepticism to becoming a high-earning professional underscores the bootcamp‚Äôs role in unlocking new career paths. 


Meanwhile, Shiran‚Äôs move from traditional tech roles into blockchain innovation stresses the importance of community and networking in professional growth. These stories collectively affirm that Metana.io prepares students to thrive and lead in the blockchain industry.
