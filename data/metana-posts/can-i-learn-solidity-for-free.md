Solidity is a high-level programming language that is primarily used to develop [smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain](https://metana.io/blog/what-is-a-smart-contract-understand-contracts-on-the-blockchain/). It is a powerful tool for creating decentralized applications that execute programmable transactions, ensuring a high level of security and transparency.


At Metana, we understand the importance of [learning Solidity for developers](https://metana.io/blog/learning-programming-languages-for-ethereum-development-python-javascript-and-solidity/) who want to build decentralized applications. In this article, we will discuss the best resources for [learning Solidity](https://metana.io/blog/is-solidity-hard-to-learn/) and how you can get started with this powerful programming language.



Free Courses to learn solidity
------------------------------


There are many high-quality Solidity courses available, both free and paid. These courses range from beginner to advanced and cover a wide range of topics. Some popular courses include:


* [Alchemy University‚Äôs Free Ethereum Developer Bootcamp](https://university.alchemy.com/)
* [Chainlink Developer Bootcamps](https://chain.link/bootcamp)


These courses are a great way to get started with Solidity to learn and gain a deeper understanding of its syntax, data structures, and [functions](https://metana.io/blog/solidity-functions-types-and-use-cases/). They also cover best practices for writing secure and efficient [smart contracts](https://metana.io/blog/smart-contract-abi/).



Solidity Documentation
----------------------


The Solidity documentation is an excellent resource for [developers](https://metana.io/blog/solidity-developer-salary/) who want to learn Solidity. It provides a comprehensive overview of the language, including its syntax, data types, and control structures. It also covers advanced topics such as inheritance, libraries, and interfaces.


The Solidity documentation is regularly updated and maintained by the Solidity team, ensuring that it is always up-to-date with the latest features and best practices.



Solidity Tools
--------------


There are many tools available for developing, testing, and deploying [Solidity smart contracts](https://metana.io/blog/extension-for-learning-solidity-and-generate-smart-contracts-using-aiprm/). Some popular tools include:


* Remix IDE
* Truffle Suite
* Ganache
* Hardhat


These tools provide a user-friendly interface for writing, testing, and deploying Solidity smart contracts. They also provide features such as debugging, automated testing, and contract verification.



Getting Started with Solidity
-----------------------------


To get started with Solidity, you should first choose a course or resource that best suits your learning style and skill level. Once you have a basic understanding of the language, you can start practicing by writing your own smart contracts.


To [write a Solidity smart contract](https://metana.io/blog/solidity-smart-contracts/), you will need to choose an Ethereum development platform, such as Remix or Truffle, and create a new project. You can then write your Solidity code and test it using the platform‚Äôs built-in testing tools.



Conclusion
----------


In conclusion, yes you can **learn solidity** for **free** but this comes with a few drawbacks. Such as the Learning new concepts can be challenging and time-consuming, especially when relying on YouTube videos. It can be frustrating when you can‚Äôt find the right content or the videos are outdated. Plus, it‚Äôs tough not having someone to ask when you have doubts or questions. It‚Äôs easy to doubt yourself and wonder if you‚Äôre really good at what you‚Äôre learning.



At Metana, we understood these problems and we came with a solution,
