Ethernaut Level 12 Walkthrough: Privacy
=======================================

**Ethernaut Level 12** titled ‚Äú**Privacy**‚Äù challenges the concept of ‚Äúprivate‚Äù data on the blockchain. In this level, you‚Äôll encounter a locked contract, and your objective is to unlock it. The key, however, isn‚Äôt so private after all! It lies in the way the [Ethereum Virtual Machine](https://metana.io/blog/ethereum-virtual-machine-evm/) (EVM) stores data. **This walkthrough will guide you through the process.**


Understanding Storage Slots
---------------------------


Imagine a shoebox with compartments. The EVM stores variables similarly, allocating 32 bytes (256 bits) to each compartment called a storage slot. The EVM is space-efficient; smaller variables like booleans (1 byte) or uint8s (1 byte) can share a slot with other variables as long as the total size doesn‚Äôt exceed 32 bytes. This level serves as a valuable lesson in understanding how the EVM stores data.


Analyze the Contract
--------------------


First, take a look at the `Privacy.sol` contract. You‚Äôll notice a variable named `data` declared as a `bytes32` array. There‚Äôs also a function called `unlock` that takes a `bytes16` argument as input.



![Ethernaut Privacy level console walkthrough with tips and contract code](https://metana.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Screenshot-2024-06-07-at-1.27.27‚ÄØPM-1-1024x552.png)
EVM Storage Shenanigans
-----------------------


The EVM packs variables efficiently to save storage space. Smaller variables like `locked` (bool) and `denomination` (uint8) share the same storage slot as the first element of the `data` array (`data[0]`).



![](https://metana.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Screenshot-2024-06-12-at-11.09.41‚ÄØAM-1024x509.png)
Unlocking the Secret
--------------------


To unlock the contract, we need the value stored in `data[2]`. That value is located at slot 5. However, the EVM stores it as `bytes32`. We need to cast it to `bytes16` to match the `unlock` function‚Äôs input.


Here‚Äôs a step-by-step guide to unlocking the contract:


1. **Use the terminal in the console:**
2. Get the Hex string of the `data[2]` at slot 5: `await web3.eth.getStorageAt(contract.address, 5)`. This will give us a string of `bytes32`. We want to convert it to `bytes16`.
3. Put that hex string in a constant: `const b32 = '0x5d6655fba48ea25651c1cad326e3a62ded205cb4464b71e0cf64951ecfe605d2'`.
4. Find the length: `b32.length` (This will return 66).
5. Convert it to `bytes16` (half the length, excluding `0x`): `const b16 = b32.slice(0, 34)`.
6. Use that value to call the `unlock` function: `contract.unlock('0x5d6655fba48ea25651c1cad326e3a62d')`.

7. Check the status of the `locked` boolean to see if it changed to `false`: `await contract.locked()`.
8. Finally, you can submit the instance. Congrats on completing this level!

Conclusion: Ethernaut level 12 (Privacy)
----------------------------------------


This challenge highlights that nothing on the blockchain is truly private, not even data declared with the `private` keyword. The [EVM‚Äôs storage](https://metana.io/blog/modifying-evm-storage-to-seed-token-balances-in-testing/) layout can reveal information you might think is hidden. So, when building [smart contracts](https://metana.io/blog/what-is-a-smart-contract-understand-contracts-on-the-blockchain/), be mindful of how data is stored and accessed. Rely on encryption or other secure mechanisms for truly sensitive information.


**Bonus Tip:** Security best practices involve keeping user data off-chain whenever possible. Consider using decentralized storage solutions for sensitive information that doesn‚Äôt require constant on-chain interaction.



![faq](https://metana.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Questions-bro-1.svg)
FAQs:
-----


1. **Can this exploit be used to steal funds from real contracts?**


No, directly exploiting storage packing like this wouldn‚Äôt be effective for stealing funds from real contracts. This technique relies on specific contract vulnerabilities and wouldn‚Äôt work universally.


2. **What are some best practices to avoid similar vulnerabilities?**


When writing smart contracts, be mindful of storage slot packing. Avoid storing sensitive data directly on-chain, and consider using encryption or alternative storage solutions for truly private information.


3. **Is there another way to solve this challenge without the Truffle console?**


Yes, it‚Äôs possible to solve this challenge using other tools or platforms that allow interaction with deployed contracts and storage slots.


4. **What if I don‚Äôt know the storage slot locations beforehand?**


Analyzing the contract code and understanding Solidity variable sizes can help you predict storage slot usage. Alternatively, some tools offer functionalities to explore storage slots on deployed contracts.


5. **What are the limitations of the ‚Äúprivate‚Äù keyword in Solidity?**


The `private` keyword in Solidity only affects code visibility within the contract itself. It doesn‚Äôt guarantee data privacy on the blockchain due to the EVM‚Äôs storage layout and potential for analysis.
