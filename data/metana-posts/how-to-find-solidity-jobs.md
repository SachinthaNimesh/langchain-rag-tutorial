![Frequently asked questions](https://metana.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/FAQs-cuate-1-1024x1024.png)
1. **Does Solidity require math?**


Yes, Solidity requires some basic math concepts, such as arithmetic, algebra, and trigonometry. However, you don‚Äôt need to be a math genius to learn Solidity.


2. **Which coding is best for the future?**


There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the best coding language for the future depends on your specific interests and goals. However, some of the most in-demand coding languages include Python, JavaScript, Java, and C++.


3. **Should I learn Solidity first?**


If you are interested in developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, then Solidity is a good language to learn first. However, if you are not sure what you want to do with coding, then it might be better to start with a more general-purpose language like Python or JavaScript.


4. **How many hours to learn Solidity?**


The amount of time it takes to learn Solidity depends on your prior programming experience and how much time you are able to commit to learning. However, you can expect to learn the basics of Solidity in a few weeks or months.


5. **Can I get a job if I learn Solidity?**


¬†Yes, there are many jobs available for Solidity developers. The demand for Solidity developers is expected to grow in the coming years, as more and more businesses adopt blockchain technology.


6. **Is Solidity still in demand?**


¬†Yes, Solidity is still in high demand. The Ethereum blockchain is one of the most popular blockchain platforms, and Solidity is the most popular language for developing smart contracts on Ethereum.


7. **How much do Solidity jobs pay?**


¬†The salary for Solidity developers varies depending on experience, location, and company. However, you can expect to earn a good salary if you have the skills and experience to develop Solidity smart contracts.


8. **Who is an NFT developer?**


An NFT developer is a software engineer who specializes in creating and deploying non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on blockchain platforms. They must have a strong understanding of blockchain technology, smart contracts, and NFT standards like ERC-721 and ERC-1155.


9. **Is Solidity high-level?**


Yes, Solidity is a high-level programming language. This means that it is closer to human language than low-level languages like C or C++. This makes it easier to learn and use, but it also means that it is less efficient.


10. **How much do Solidity coders make?**


According to our research, the average [salary for a Solidity developer](https://metana.io/blog/solidity-developer-salary/#:~:text=According%20to%20our%20research%2C%20the,%24120%2C000%20to%20%24225%2C000%20per%20year.) in the United States ranges from $120,000 to $225,000 per year.


11. **Is Solidity coding hard?**


One of the reasons why Solidity is [**easy to learn**](https://metana.io/blog/is-solidity-hard-to-learn/#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20reasons%20why,its%20clear%20and%20concise%20syntax.) is its similarity to other programming languages. If you have experience with JavaScript or C++, you will find the syntax of Solidity quite familiar. Solidity code is also easy to read and understand, thanks to its clear and concise syntax.


12. **Can I learn Solidity if I know Python?**


If you are already familiar with a programming language like JavaScript or Python, then you will find it relatively easy to learn Solidity. This is because Solidity shares many similarities with these languages, such as its syntax and logic.
