What is an Oracle in Blockchain? A Complete Guide
=================================================

 



 * [Metana Editorial](https://metana.io/blog/author/editorial/)
* [September 25, 2023](https://metana.io/blog/2023/09/25/)
* [Blockchain](https://metana.io/blog/category/blockchain/)














An **oracle in blockchain** is like a helper that lets a blockchain network connect with other data sources or systems. It‚Äôs like a bridge between the blockchain and the outside world. Oracles let smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) to use and react to data from the real world.


So, Why are These Oracles Important?
------------------------------------


They‚Äôre important because they let smart contracts and dApps make decisions based on real-world data. Oracles let the blockchain access information like market prices, weather conditions, or data from Internet of Things (IoT) sensors. They make [blockchain application](https://metana.io/blog/major-applications-of-the-blockchain/)s more useful by letting them interact with the wider world. This means we can do even more things on a blockchain.


![what is an oracle in blockchain (crypto)](https://metana.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/oracle-blockchain-1024x724.png)
Types of Blockchain Oracles:
----------------------------


There are several types of blockchain oracles, including:


1. **Software Oracles**: These oracles use software to connect with digital sources of information, such as APIs, web scraping, or data feeds. They retrieve data from these sources and provide it to the blockchain network.
2. **Hardware Oracles**: Hardware oracles are physical devices that collect and transmit data from the real world to the blockchain. They can be sensors, IoT devices, or other hardware components that capture and relay data.
3. **Inbound Oracles**: Inbound oracles bring external data into the blockchain network. They retrieve data from off-chain sources and provide it to [smart contracts](https://metana.io/blog/what-is-a-smart-contract-understand-contracts-on-the-blockchain/) or dApps on the blockchain.
4. **Outbound Oracles**: Outbound oracles allow smart contracts or dApps to send commands or trigger actions in external systems or devices. They enable the blockchain to interact with off-chain systems, such as making payments or controlling IoT devices.
5. **Cross-Chain Oracles**: Cross-chain oracles facilitate the exchange of information and assets between different blockchains. They enable interoperability and communication between separate blockchain networks.
6. **Compute-Enabled Oracles**: Compute-enabled oracles focus on relaying complex off-chain computations to trigger various functions on-chain. They handle computations that are too complex to be performed directly on the blockchain.


How Does Oracle Blockchain Work?
--------------------------------


Blockchain oracles serve as the vital link that connects the on-chain world of blockchain and smart contracts with the off-chain real world. Oracles provide essential data inputs to trigger smart contract executions or validate conditions within a smart contract.


### How Oracles Work with Smart Contracts


Here‚Äôs a step-by-step breakdown of how oracles function in conjunction with smart contracts:



![](https://metana.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/working-mechanism-724x1024.png)
1. **Data Request:** A smart contract is programmed to initiate a data request. This request could stem from a preset condition or an event in the smart contract‚Äôs operation that requires external data.
2. **Data Retrieval:** Next, the oracle fetches the requested data from the specified external source(s). The source could be an online API, a data feed, a server, or even another blockchain.
3. **Data Verification (for Decentralized Oracles):** If the oracle is decentralized, it doesn‚Äôt just retrieve data from a single source. Instead, it fetches the same piece of data from multiple sources and validates the data by achieving consensus between these sources. This step significantly enhances the credibility and authenticity of the data.
4. **Data Transmission:** Once the data is fetched (and verified in the case of decentralized oracles), the oracle pushes this data onto the blockchain.
5. **Smart Contract Execution:** Now, the smart contract integrates this data as an input to its execution logic. If the data meets the predefined conditional statements in the contract, it triggers the contract, which automatically executes the encoded operation.


### Real-World Examples of Oracle Usage


1. **Insurance Claims:** In the case of decentralized flight insurance, for instance, an oracle fetches flight status data from airline databases or aviation authorities. If a flight is delayed or cancelled, the oracle feeds this data to the smart contract, which automatically triggers a payout to the insured party.
2. **Decentralized Finance (DeFi):** In DeFi applications, oracles relay real-time price information of cryptocurrencies from various exchanges to smart contracts. This data is critical to maintain the operation of lending platforms, stablecoins, and derivatives on the blockchain.
3. **Supply Chain:** In a blockchain-based supply chain system, IoT sensors act as oracles to provide real-time data about the location, temperature, and other conditions of goods. This data can trigger smart contracts at various stages in the supply chain, ensuring transparency and automating actions based on predefined conditions.


Blockchain oracles, therefore, play a pivotal role in extending the functionality and utility of smart contracts, enabling them to interact with real-world data and ensuring their autonomous operation.


The Oracle Problem
------------------


Inside the decentralized world of blockchain, oracles stand out because they‚Äôre not usually decentralized. Blockchains are decentralized, but most oracles are not. They use one main source for information. This creates a trust issue that goes against the decentralized nature of blockchain. We call this the ‚Äòoracle problem‚Äô.


The main problem with oracles is that we have to trust them. They use external, often centralized, data sources. This makes oracles a potential weak point in the security of a blockchain network.


If an oracle is hacked or if the data it uses is wrong, it can give bad information to the smart contract. This can lead to things going wrong. This problem is even bigger when the smart contract involves a lot of money. Wrong data can lead to big financial losses.


### Ongoing Solutions and Research



![Solutions for oracle problem](https://metana.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/oracle-problem-1024x724.png)
Addressing this problem is an active area of research, with several potential solutions proposed and being tested:


1. **Multiple Oracles:** Using multiple oracles to fetch the same data can ensure more reliability. The idea is to build a consensus from data fetched by multiple oracles instead of relying on a single source of truth.
2. **Decentralized Oracles:** Decentralized oracles aim to use the power of blockchain to distribute the task of data verification among various nodes or data sources, removing the need for a single trusted oracle.
3. **Prediction Markets:** Prediction markets like Augur allow users to bet on real-world events‚Äô outcomes, effectively crowdsourcing the oracle‚Äôs job and distributing the trust requirement.
4. **On-chain Data Verification:** Some solutions propose the use of on-chain data verification. Such methods involve comparing the fetched data against other on-chain parameters or data points to verify its accuracy.
5. **Staked Oracles:** Oracles can be required to stake or deposit a certain amount of **crypto**currency as collateral. If they deliver incorrect information, they risk losing their stake.


The oracle problem is a critical hurdle to be overcome in broadening the functionality, security, and decentralization of blockchain networks. With ongoing research and the development of new solutions, the [blockchain](https://metana.io/blog/how-does-the-blockchain-work-blockchain-technology-explained-in-simple-words/) community is actively exploring ways to solve this problem and enhance the trustless nature of blockchain technology.
