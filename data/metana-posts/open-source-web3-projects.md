* [Web3.0](https://metana.io/blog/category/web3-0/)














Web3 is the new wave of the internet. Unlike our current Web2, Web3 allows direct interactions between different parties. This means there are no middlemen in digital exchanges. It‚Äôs moving us from a web controlled by a few companies, to a web controlled by us, the users. This is all thanks to blockchain and cryptography. At the heart of this change are **open-source web3 projects**. These projects let everyone see, use, and change their code. This article will talk about these **web3 projects** and how they‚Äôre shaping our future.

### Decentralized Finance (DeFi)


#### 5. [**Uniswap**](https://github.com/Uniswap):


Uniswap‚Äôs automated market maker (AMM) model democratizes token trading by eliminating the need for centralized exchanges and letting users directly control their assets. Uniswap‚Äôs open-source code has inspired numerous forks and variations, nourishing a vibrant DeFi landscape driven by innovation and community contributions.


#### 6. **[Compound](https://github.com/compound-finance/)**:


Compound, an open-source lending protocol, is more than just a tool for earning interest. It‚Äôs about reimagining financial services in a way that is both accessible and transparent. With Compound, anyone can become a lender or borrow, and because the code is open-source, the community can make improvements as user needs evolve.


#### 7. **[Aave](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core)**:


Aave is more than a lending protocol offering flexible loan options. Its open-source nature enables developers to build custom DeFi applications atop its protocol, promoting a diverse selection of lending and borrowing experiences and highlighting the power of open-source collaboration in DeFi.


### Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)


#### 8. **[OpenSea](https://github.com/ProjectOpenSea)**:


OpenSea is more than just a platform for trading digital art. It‚Äôs a community hub where creators and collectors connect, ideas come to life, and the boundaries of art and ownership are constantly being redefined. OpenSea‚Äôs open API allows developers to create innovative NFT experiences, expanding the possibilities of this transformative technology.


#### 9. **[Rarible](https://github.com/rarible)**:


Rarible goes beyond offering multi-chain support and fractional ownership. It‚Äôs open-source nature fosters a truly community-owned platform. Its governance token empowers users to influence the platform‚Äôs direction, ensuring it remains responsive to the needs of creators and collectors.


#### 10. **[Mirror](https://github.com/Mirror-Protocol)**:


Mirror, a publishing platform powered by NFTs, is about more than just monetizing content. It‚Äôs about building sustainable communities around creators. Mirror‚Äôs open-source code allows developers to integrate its features into their own platforms, contributing to a more democratized creation and distribution of content in the Web3 era.



![](https://metana.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/NFT-pana-1.svg)
### Social Media and Identity


#### 11. **[Farcaster](https://github.com/farcasterxyz/)**:


Farcaster is an open-source social network that gives users control over their data and content. Its pods, built on IPFS, ensure data resilience and resistance to censorship. This paves the way for a more user-centric and independent social media landscape.


#### 12. **[Lens Protocol](https://github.com/lens-protocol/core)**:


Lens Protocol is more than just a platform for building decentralized social media applications. It enables developers to create unique experiences that prioritize user control and community governance. This open-source protocol encourages a diverse ecosystem of social apps, demonstrating that Web3 is not a monolithic platform, but a tapestry of innovative experiences.


#### 13. **[SelfKey](https://github.com/SelfKeyFoundation)**:


SelfKey, an identity management platform, is about more than secure logins. It‚Äôs about empowering individuals with control over their personal data. SelfKey‚Äôs open-source code allows developers to integrate its features into their applications, fostering a future where users own and manage their digital identities.
