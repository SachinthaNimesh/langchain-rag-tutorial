What is an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and How It Works?
===========================================================

* [August 8, 2023](https://metana.io/blog/2023/08/08/)
* [Blockchain](https://metana.io/blog/category/blockchain/), [Web3.0](https://metana.io/blog/category/web3-0/)














**What is a Virtual Machine (VM)?**
-----------------------------------


A virtual machine (VM) is a software program that creates a virtual computer within your physical computer. This virtual computer can run its own operating system and software, and it is isolated from the rest of your computer. This makes VMs useful for a variety of purposes, such as:


* Running multiple operating systems on the same computer
* Testing software in a safe environment
* Isolating malware from the rest of your computer


**What is The Ethereum Virtual Machine Definition?**
----------------------------------------------------


*Did you know that the Ethereum Virtual Machine was originally designed to be a simple machine that could only execute simple transactions?*


However, over time, it has evolved into a powerful tool that can be used to execute complex applications.The Ethereum Virtual Machine is a special type of VM that is used to run smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. [Smart contracts](https://metana.io/blog/extension-for-learning-solidity-and-generate-smart-contracts-using-aiprm/) are self-executing agreements that are stored on the blockchain. They can be used to automate a wide variety of tasks, such as:


* Transferring money between accounts
* Creating tokens
* Managing ownership of assets


The Ethereum Virtual Machine is a Turing-complete machine, which means that it can theoretically execute any program. However, the EVM is also limited by the amount of gas that is available for each transaction. Gas is a unit of measurement that is used to track the computational resources used by each operation.


**How the Ethereum Virtual Machine Works?**
-------------------------------------------


The Ethereum Virtual Machine is a stack-based virtual machine that runs on every Ethereum node. It executes [smart contracts](https://metana.io/blog/what-is-a-smart-contract-understand-contracts-on-the-blockchain/), which are self-executing agreements between two parties. The EVM uses a stack to store the state of the program and to perform computations. It also uses gas to track the amount of computational resources used by each transaction. The Ethereum Virtual Machine first validates the code of each transaction before it is executed. If the code is valid, it then executes the transaction, which may involve updating the state of the blockchain or sending funds to another account.


The EVM uses bytecodes and opcodes to execute smart contracts. Bytecodes are the instructions that the Ethereum Virtual Machine executes, and opcodes are the codes that represent these instructions. There are over 140 opcodes in the EVM, each of which performs a specific operation.


Here is an example of how bytecodes and opcodes work. The following bytecode is the instruction to add two numbers together:


***0x01 0x02 0x03 0x00***


This bytecode is interpreted by the EVM as follows:


* 0x01 is the opcode for the **ADD**instruction.
* 0x02 is the first operand.
* 0x03 is the second operand.
* 0x00 is the return value.


The EVM will first load the first operand (0x02) onto the stack. Then, it will load the second operand (0x03) onto the stack. Finally, it will execute the **ADD** instruction, which will add the two operands together and store the result (0x05) on the stack.


*Few examples of EVM Opcodes*:




| Opcode | Hex Code | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ADD | 0x01 | Binary operation that adds the top two items from the stack and pushes the result back onto the stack. |
| MUL | 0x02 | Binary operation that multiplies the top two stack items and pushes the result back onto the stack. |
| SUB | 0x03 | Binary operation that subtracts the second stack item from the first (top two items on the stack) and pushes the result back onto the stack. |
| DIV | 0x04 | Binary operation that divides the first stack item by the second and pushes the quotient back onto the stack. If it is a division by zero, it pushes zero. |
| JUMP | 0x56 | Unconditional jump operation that replaces the program counter with the top item from the stack. The next opcode is taken from that position in the code. |
| JUMPI | 0x57 | Conditional jump operation that takes two arguments from the stack. If the first item is non-zero, it sets the program counter to the value of the second item. Otherwise, no effect. |
| PUSH1, PUSH32 | 0x60 ‚Äì 0x7f | Places 1 to 32 bytes item on stack. For instance, PUSH1 might place a single byte onto the stack, while PUSH32 would place 32 bytes onto the stack. |
| CALL | 0xf1 | Executes a new message call and sends the output data from the executed contract back to the current one. It takes seven arguments from the stack. |



EVM opcodes examples


The EVM will continue to execute bytecodes in this way until the entire [smart contract](https://metana.io/blog/solidity-smart-contracts/) has been executed. The EVM is a complex piece of software, but it is essential to the functioning of the Ethereum network. It allows Ethereum to be a platform for decentralized applications, and it is responsible for ensuring that the Ethereum network is secure and reliable.


Now that we have gained some insights into the execution of bytecode by the EVM, let‚Äôs proceed to grasp the concept of the Ethereum state transition function.


**The Ethereum State Transition Function**
------------------------------------------


The Ethereum State Transition Function (STF) is a mathematical function that describes how the state of the Ethereum blockchain changes over time. The STF takes two inputs: the current state of the blockchain and a transaction. The STF then outputs the new state of the blockchain after the transaction has been executed.


The mathematical function for the STF is as follows:


***STF(S, T) = S‚Äô***


Where:


* **S** is the current **state** of the blockchain
* **T** is a **transaction**
* **S‚Äô** is the **new state** of the blockchain after the transaction has been executed


The STF is a key part of the Ethereum blockchain. It is responsible for ensuring that the blockchain is secure and reliable, and it allows Ethereum to be a platform for decentralized applications.

* **Use safe coding practices:** There are a number of safe coding practices that can help to mitigate security risks. These practices include using secure functions, avoiding reentrancy attacks, and testing your smart contracts thoroughly before deploying them.
* **Use a security audit:** If you are creating a complex smart contract, you may want to consider having it audited by a security expert. This can help to identify any potential security risks before they are exploited.


By following these tips, you can help to ensure that your use of the EVM is safe and secure.


**What are some examples of how the EVM is being used in real-world applications?**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


* **Decentralized finance (DeFi):** DeFi is a rapidly growing ecosystem of financial applications that are built on top of the Ethereum blockchain. These applications allow users to lend, borrow, and trade assets without the need for a central authority. Some of the most popular DeFi applications include MakerDAO, Compound, and Uniswap.
* **Non-fungible tokens (NFTs):** NFTs are a type of digital asset that is unique and cannot be replaced. They are often used to represent ownership of digital artworks, collectibles, and other items. Some of the most popular NFT platforms include OpenSea, Rarible, and Foundation.
* **Gaming:** The EVM is also being used to power a new generation of decentralized games. These games are built on top of the Ethereum blockchain and allow players to own their in-game assets. Some of the most popular decentralized games include Axie Infinity, The Sandbox, and Gods Unchained.
* **Supply chain management:** The EVM can also be used to improve the efficiency and transparency of supply chain management. For example, it can be used to track the movement of goods and to verify the authenticity of products. Some of the companies that are using the EVM for supply chain management include Walmart, IBM, and SAP.


These are just a few examples of how the EVM is being used in real-world applications. As the EVM continues to evolve, it is likely to be used in even more innovative and creative ways.
