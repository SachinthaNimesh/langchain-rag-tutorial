The world of smart contracts keeps changing, with new languages coming out all the time. Vyper is one of these new languages. It‚Äôs a lot like Python and is built to be safe, efficient, and user-friendly.


In this article, we‚Äôre going to explore Vyper. We‚Äôll talk about what it can do, its pros and cons, and what we can expect from it in the future. We‚Äôll also show you some examples of Vyper code.


So, if you‚Äôre interested in learning about Vyper, or if you‚Äôre looking for a new language to use for your smart contracts, keep reading.


**What is Vyper?**
------------------


![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/WKxfxh0PqlXTJ7Cq_qeUa6ikIU7CBqfL9yITPa0F7j2qqnLv_3mRQ03ZuJyAa5o3UVmfh_2HWw1KX7tckyEld2smobTur8IVBbmHecufmdm9mLtABWHmYnRcbs7vyDCVI4QtMV5muC4SvGk0_WsRpLM)


Vyper is a language that‚Äôs a lot like Python. It‚Äôs used to write smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. It‚Äôs made to be easy to learn and use, but also powerful enough to create complex smart contracts.


*Did you know that Vyper is still being worked on? This means it still has some features that aren‚Äôt finished yet.*


But, the Vyper team is working hard to make the language complete and reliable. The team at ConsenSys first released Vyper in 2016. It was meant to be a successor to Serpent, another language like Python for Ethereum smart contracts.


Overall, Vyper is good for developers who want a safe, efficient, and user-friendly language for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. But, it‚Äôs important to remember that it‚Äôs still a pretty new language, so there are some downsides to using it.


**How do you use Vyper?**
-------------------------


Here are three ways to use Vyper:


* **The Vyper compiler:** The Vyper compiler can be used to compile Vyper code into bytecode that can be deployed to the Ethereum blockchain.
* **The Vyper REPL:** The Vyper REPL can be used to interactively execute Vyper code.
* **The Vyper documentation:** The Vyper documentation provides a comprehensive reference guide for the language.


Here is how to use them:




| **The Vyper compiler** | **The Vyper REPL** | **The Vyper documentation** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Install the Vyper compiler | Install the Vyper REPL. | Go to the Vyper documentation website. |
| Create a Vyper file. | Start the Vyper REPL. | Search for the topic you are interested in. |
| Write Vyper code in the file. | Enter Vyper code in the REPL. | Read the documentation. |
| Compile the Vyper code using the Vyper command. | Execute the Vyper code by pressing Enter. |  |
| Deploy the bytecode to the Ethereum blockchain. |  |  |



![Vyper (Smart Contracts)](https://metana.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Smart-Contract.png)
In this diagram, we start with the constructor initialization, where the contract is deployed and initialized with any initial values or settings. Then, the execution flow moves to the main part of the smart contract.


During the execution of the smart contract, various functions and operations defined within the contract are executed. These functions can modify the contract‚Äôs state variables, perform calculations, or interact with other contracts or external services.


The execution flow can also involve external calls, where the smart contract interacts with other smart contracts, external services, or receives input from users or external sources. These external calls can trigger further execution within the smart contract or retrieve information from external sources.


**What are the Features of Vyper?**
-----------------------------------


**Simple syntax:** 


Vyper has a way of writing code that‚Äôs like Python. This makes it easy for developers who know Python to learn Vyper. Developers who already know Python can start writing Vyper code without having to learn a new way of writing. Also, because Vyper and Python are so similar, it‚Äôs easy for developers to find resources and tools for Vyper. Many of the same resources and tools for Python can also be used for Vyper.


**Strong typing:** 


Vyper is a strongly typed language, which means that the types of variables and expressions must be declared explicitly. This helps to prevent errors by ensuring that the compiler knows the type of each variable and expression. Additionally, strong typing can make code more readable by making it clear what the types of variables and expressions are.


**Security features:** 


Vyper also has a lot of security features built in. For example, it can estimate gas and check types. Estimating gas helps stop contracts from being too expensive to run, and checking types helps avoid errors. It also has other security features like support for modifiers and access control.


**Efficiency:** 


Vyper is also quite efficient. This means smart contracts written in Vyper are less likely to use up a lot of gas. Gas is how we measure the cost of running a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. The less gas a smart contract uses, the less it costs to run. Vyper‚Äôs efficiency is partly because of its simple way of writing code and its strong typing.


In short, Vyper is a good choice for developers who want a secure, efficient, and easy-to-use language for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Its similarity to Python makes it easy to learn and use. Its built-in security features help protect against common mistakes in smart contracts. Also, because Vyper is efficient, it can help keep the cost of running smart contracts low.



```
#This is a simple example of a Vyper contract

contract Helloworld {

#This is a public function that prints "Hello, world!" 
  function hello() public {
    print("Hello, world!");
  }
}
```


This code defines a simple smart contract called HelloWorld. The contract has a public function called **hello()** that prints the string **‚ÄúHello, world!**‚Äù to the console.



```
#This is an example of a Vyper contract that stores a value 
contract Storage {

#This is a private variable. that stores the value 
  private value: uint256;

#This is a public function that sets the value 
  function set(value: uint256) public { 
    this.value= value;
      }

#This is a public function that gets the value

  function get() public view returns (uint256) {
    return this.value;

      }
}
```

This code defines a contract called **Storage** that stores a value. The contract has two public functions: **set()** and **get().** The **set()** function sets the value, and the **get()** function gets the value.


**What are the Benefits of using Vyper?**
-----------------------------------------


**Easy to Learn and Use:**


Even if you‚Äôre not familiar with Python or other coding languages, Vyper is fairly easy to learn and use. Since Vyper is a lot like Python, people who already know Python can start writing Vyper code without learning a new language. Plus, because Vyper and Python are so similar, it‚Äôs easy to find resources and tools to help you.


**Auditability:**


With its simple code and strong typing, it‚Äôs easier to check Vyper smart contracts for problems. The code is less complex, so it‚Äôs simpler to read and understand. This makes it easier to spot potential security issues.


**Community:**


There‚Äôs a growing community of Vyper developers who are actively working on and supporting the language. This means there are resources and tools available for developers, and the language is likely to continue to evolve and improve over time.


Vyper is a versatile language that can be used to create a wide variety of smart contracts. This is because Vyper has many features that make it suitable for a variety of purposes. For example, Vyper has support for:


* **Mutable and immutable variables:** This allows developers to create smart contracts that can be updated or that cannot be updated.
* **Structs and enums:** This allows developers to create complex data structures that can be used to store and manipulate data.
* **Functions and modifiers:** This allows developers to create reusable code and control access to certain parts of a smart contract.
* **Events:** This allows developers to notify other smart contracts of events that have occurred.


**What are the Drawbacks of using Vyper?**
------------------------------------------


**Not as Mature as Solidity:**


Vyper came out in 2016, two years after Solidity. This means Solidity has had more time to grow and there are more libraries and tools for developers who use it. This can make it harder to find resources and tools for Vyper, and fewer people might know the language.


**Not as Widely Supported:**


Vyper isn‚Äôt as widely supported by development environments as Solidity. This means developers might have to use a different development environment if they want to use Vyper. For example, some popular development environments like Remix and Truffle don‚Äôt currently support Vyper.


**Limited Functionality:**


Vyper is a simpler language, so it doesn‚Äôt have all the features of other languages like Solidity. Some developers might find Vyper too limited for what they need. For instance, Vyper doesn‚Äôt support some features that are often used in Solidity, like inheritance and dynamic arrays.


**Not as Well-Tested:**


Vyper is a newer language, so it hasn‚Äôt been tested as much as languages like Solidity. This means there‚Äôs a greater risk of finding bugs in Vyper code. Vyper hasn‚Äôt been used as much as Solidity, so there‚Äôs less information on how reliable it is.


However, Vyper is secure, efficient, and easy to learn and use. If you want a language that‚Äôs safe, efficient, and easy to learn, Vyper might be a good choice for you. But, if you need a language with all the features of Solidity or one that‚Äôs as widely supported as Solidity, you might want to consider using Solidity instead.


**What does the Future hold for Vyper?**
----------------------------------------


The future of Vyper is uncertain, but many factors suggest that it could become a more popular language in the future.


* Vyper is a relatively new language, so it is still under development. This means that there is potential for the language to improve over time, and Vyper may eventually become more mature and widely supported.
* Vyper is a secure and efficient language, and it is easy to learn and use. This makes it a good choice for developers who are looking for a language that is secure, efficient, and easy to learn.
* There is a growing community of Vyper developers. This means that there is a pool of developers who are interested in using and developing Vyper, and this could help to drive the adoption of the language.


Here are some of the things that could help to promote the future of Vyper:


* **Increased maturity and support:** If Vyper can become more mature and widely supported, then it will be more attractive to developers. This could be achieved by increasing the number of libraries and tools available for Vyper, and by making Vyper more compatible with other development environments.
* **Increased functionality:** If Vyper can be extended to provide more functionality, then it will be more appealing to developers who need a language with a wider range of features. This could be achieved by adding support for features that are commonly used in Solidity, such as inheritance and dynamic arrays.
* **Improved testing:** If Vyper can be better tested, then it will be more reliable and less likely to contain bugs. This could be achieved by increasing the amount of testing that is done on Vyper code, and by making Vyper more compatible with existing testing frameworks.


If Vyper can address these challenges, then it could become a more viable alternative to Solidity. However, it is important to note that the future of Vyper is uncertain, and there is no guarantee that it will become more popular in the future.


**Success Stories**
-------------------


Vyper is a relatively new language, but it has already been used to create a number of successful projects. Here are a few examples:


**Arbitrum** is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum that uses Vyper to create smart contracts. Arbitrum is designed to be more efficient and secure than Ethereum, and it has been used by a number of projects, including Chainlink, Synthetix, and Balancer.
